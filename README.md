HI-Player

HI-Player is a high-quality music playback software for music lovers; based on Mac/Windows operating system of x86/arm, it has the ability of playing local music files, streaming, playing, and pushing to professional audio decoders; the ability to frequency up/ down any PCM sampling rate file (including various PCM compression formats such as flac, ape, mp3, aac, etc.) to a specified PCM sampling rate or DSD sampling rate; it also has the ability to resample any DSD format (DSD64~DSD1024) to the specified DSD format or PCM format playback;
For DSD512, we use conventional equipment to play back stably and smoothly, the CPU occupation is low, so we do not need to buy expensive computing machines, which save costs and protects the environment.
For streaming media support, HI-Player currently supports the mobile iPhone AIRPlay push-stream reception capabilities, deeply optimized AirPlay protocol stack, and supports smooth playback audio under weak networks; you can push the files on your phone to Mac/Windows devices for direct enjoyment or frequency up and forward to DAC for enjoyment;
